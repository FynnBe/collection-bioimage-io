name: CycleGAN (2D) - ZeroCostDL4Mic
description: >-
  CycleGAN is a method that can capture the characteristics of one image domain
  and figure out how these characteristics could be translated into another
  image domain, all in the absence of any paired training examples (ie transform
  a horse into zebra or apples into oranges). While CycleGAN can potentially be
  used for any type of image-to-image translation, we illustrate that it can be
  used to predict what a fluorescent label would look like when imaged using
  another imaging modalities. Note - visit the ZeroCostDL4Mic wiki to check the
  original publications this network is based on and make sure you cite these.
