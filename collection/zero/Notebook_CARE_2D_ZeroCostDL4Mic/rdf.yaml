description: >-
  CARE is a neural network capable of image restoration from corrupted
  bio-images, first published in 2018 by Weigert et al. in Nature Methods. The
  network allows image denoising and resolution improvement in 2D and 3D images,
  in a supervised training manner. The function of the network is essentially
  determined by the set of images provided in the training dataset. For
  instance, if noisy images are provided as input and high signal-to-noise ratio
  images are provided as targets, the network will perform denoising. Note -
  visit the ZeroCostDL4Mic wiki to check the original publications this network
  is based on and make sure you cite these.
