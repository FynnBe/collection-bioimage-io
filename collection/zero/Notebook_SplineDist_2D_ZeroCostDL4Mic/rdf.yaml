name: SplineDist (2D) - ZeroCostDL4Mic
description: >-
  SplineDist is a neural network inspired by StarDist, capable of performing
  image instance segmentation. Unlike StarDist, SplineDist uses cubic splines to
  describe the contour of each object and therefore can potentially segment
  objects of any shapes. This version is only for 2D dataset. Note - visit the
  ZeroCostDL4Mic wiki to check the original publications this network is based
  on and make sure you cite these.
