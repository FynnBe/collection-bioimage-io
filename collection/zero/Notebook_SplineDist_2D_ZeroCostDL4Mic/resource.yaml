    description: Instance segmentation of 2D images. SplineDist is a neural network
      inspired by StarDist, capable of performing image instance segmentation. Unlike
      StarDist, SplineDist uses cubic splines to describe the contour of each object
      and therefore can potentially segment objects of any shapes. This version is
      only for 2D dataset. Note - visit the ZeroCostDL4Mic wiki to check the original
      publications this network is based on and make sure you cite these.
