name: U-Net (3D) - ZeroCostDL4Mic
description: >-
  The 3D U-Net was first introduced by Çiçek et al for learning dense volumetric
  segmentations from sparsely annotated ground-truth data building upon the
  original U-Net architecture by Ronneberger et al. Note - visit the
  ZeroCostDL4Mic wiki to check the original publications this network is based
  on and make sure you cite these.
