description: >-
  Label-free Prediction (fnet) is a neural network used to infer the features of
  cellular structures from brightfield or EM images without coloured labels. The
  network is trained using paired training images from the same field of view,
  imaged in a label-free (e.g. brightfield) and labelled condition (e.g.
  fluorescent protein). When trained, this allows the user to identify certain
  structures from brightfield images alone. The performance of fnet may depend
  significantly on the structure at hand. Note - visit the ZeroCostDL4Mic wiki
  to check the original publications this network is based on and make sure you
  cite these.
