description: >-
  DenoiSeg 2D is deep-learning method that can be used to jointly denoise and
  segment 2D microscopy images. The benefits of using DenoiSeg (compared to
  other Deep Learning-based segmentation methods) are more prononced when only a
  few annotated images are available. However, the denoising part requires many
  images to perform well. All the noisy images don't need to be labeled to train
  DenoiSeg. Note - visit the ZeroCostDL4Mic wiki to check the original
  publications this network is based on and make sure you cite these.
