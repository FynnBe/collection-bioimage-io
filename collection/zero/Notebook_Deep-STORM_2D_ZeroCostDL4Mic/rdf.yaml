description: >-
  Deep-STORM is a neural network capable of image reconstruction from
  high-density single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM), first published
  in 2018 by Nehme et al. in Optica. This network allows image reconstruction of
  2D super-resolution images, in a supervised training manner. The network is
  trained using simulated high-density SMLM data for which the ground-truth is
  available. These simulations are obtained from random distribution of single
  molecules in a field-of-view and therefore do not imprint structural priors
  during training. The network output a super-resolution image with increased
  pixel density (typically upsampling factor of 8 in each dimension). Note -
  visit the ZeroCostDL4Mic wiki to check the original publications this network
  is based on and make sure you cite these.
