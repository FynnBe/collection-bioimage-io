description: >-
  Augmentor is a data augmentation library. Data augmentation can improve
  training progress by amplifying differences in the dataset. This can be useful
  if the available dataset is small since, in this case, it is possible that a
  network could quickly learn every example in the dataset (overfitting),
  without augmentation. Augmentation can be especially valuable when training
  dataset need to be manually labelled. Note - visit the ZeroCostDL4Mic wiki to
  check the original publications this network is based on and make sure you
  cite these.
