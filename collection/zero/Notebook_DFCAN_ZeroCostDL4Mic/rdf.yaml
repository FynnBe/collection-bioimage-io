  Deep Fourier channel attention network (DFCAN) is a network created to
  transform low-resolution (LR) images to super-resolved (SR) images, published
  by Qiao, Chang and Li, Di and Guo, Yuting and Liu, Chong and Jiang, Tao and
  Dai, Qionghai and Li, Dong. The training is done using LR-SR image pairs,
  taking the LR images as input and obtaining an output as close to SR as
  posible.
