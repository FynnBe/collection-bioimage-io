name: U-Net (2D) multilabel segmentation - ZeroCostDL4Mic
description: >-
  U-Net is an encoder-decoder architecture originally used for image
  segmentation. The first half of the U-Net architecture is a downsampling
  convolutional neural network which acts as a feature extractor from input
  images. The other half upsamples these results and restores an image by
  combining results from downsampling with the upsampled images. Note - visit
  the ZeroCostDL4Mic wiki to check the original publications this network is
  based on and make sure you cite these.
