description: >-
  U-Net is an encoder-decoder architecture originally used for image
  segmentation. The first half of the U-Net architecture is a downsampling
  convolutional neural network which acts as a feature extractor from input
  images. The other half upsamples these results and restores an image by
  combining results from downsampling with the upsampled images. Note - visit
  the ZeroCostDL4Mic wiki to check the original publications this network is
  based on and make sure you cite these. Networks trained in this notebook can
  be used in Fiji via deepImageJ.
